### Data Source
The data that I am going to extract is the football team statistics from top 5 European football leagues on datahub. There are 5 leagues (English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1) and 10 seasons (2009/2010â€“2018/2019) of data stored in csv format. There are 50 csv files that I am going to extract from the data source.
